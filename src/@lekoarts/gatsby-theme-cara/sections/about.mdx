## About

I graduated from the Kyiv National Economic University in 2007. My first experience in the banking sector helped me to gain a lot of knowledge in the fintech area, but after a couple of years, I found myself leaning more towards software development rather than paperwork.

I was into programming and technologies since early childhood and in 2010 decided to make it my profession. I started as a web developer on personal projects and as a freelancer at Upwork (oDesk by that time). Being persistent, I was able to achieve "Top rated freelancer" and "100% client satisfaction" badges in just a couple of years.

Since then, I have had a lot of different projects and experiences which are described in detail on my LinkedIn page. I have also completed my remote certified studies at a well-known “CS50's Introduction to Computer Science” by Harvard University.

For today I gained 10+ years of experience in predominantly web and mobile software development, including 4+ years of leading roles positions.

Nowadays I'm based with my family in Luxembourg working at the CGI company and always curious to meet new people and discover new opportunities.
