## About

I was made in Ukraine and graduated from the Kyiv National Economic University in 2007. My first experience in the banking sector helped me to gain a lot of knowledge in the fintech area, but after a couple of years, I found myself leaning more towards software development rather than paper work.

I was into programming and technologies since early childhood and in 2011 decided to choose it as my profession. I started as a web developer on personal projects and as a freelancer at Upwork (oDesk by that time). Being persistent, I was able to achieve "Top rated freelancer" and "100% client satisfaction" badges in just a couple of years.

Since then, I have had a lot of different projects and experiences which are described in detail on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coderbit/) page. I have also successfully completed my remote studies at a well-known “CS50's Introduction to Computer Science” by the Harvard University and I have the relevant certification.

For today I gained 10+ years of mainly web and mobile software development experience including 4+ years of the leading roles positions.

Nowadays I'm based with my family in Luxembourg working at the CGI company. I'm always curious to meet new people and discover new opportunities.
